## Design Features: Styling set up in my style.css
- the main theme for this project was is to have a sleek user friendly interface
- for this I chose a glassmorphism theme which gives a modern look to the website without distracting the user from the main functionality
- I employed this theme using my css classes named glassmorphismCard and glassmorphismSideBarCard
- alongside the glassmorphismSideBarCard class for my side bar I used css psudo elements such as :hover and ::before to allow me to add some basic stling animations in order to capture more attention from the user towards the side bar
- alongside the glassmorphism style I then used a liner gradient grey background to finsish off the modern look and feel of the website
